1. Project Structure
  Landing Page: Built using pure JavaScript for simplicity and to meet the requirement of using no frameworks.
  Weather App: Developed with React to leverage component-based architecture and manage state easily.

2. Communication between Projects
  Method: Used postMessage for cross-origin communication between the landing page and the weather app. This was chosen for its effectiveness in passing data between two different domains.
  Reasoning: Using postMessage allows for easy communication without needing to modify server configurations for CORS.

3. Weather API Integration
  API Used: OpenWeatherMap API.
  Parameters: Included latitude and longitude for location-based weather data.
  Error Handling: Implemented checks for API response to handle cases where the weather data might not be available.

4. State Management in Weather App
  Choice of Redux Toolkit: Opted for Redux Toolkit for state management in the weather app, as it simplifies the store setup and provides powerful tools for handling side effects.

5. User Experience
  Geolocation: Implemented geolocation to automatically fetch the userâ€™s current location.
  Fallback Option: Provided a manual city selector for users who disable geolocation.

6. Testing Strategy
  Unit Tests: Wrote unit tests for the useGeolocation hook and the weather app components to ensure functionality.
  E2E Tests: Used Cypress for end-to-end testing to verify the overall workflow of the application.

7. Deployment
  Platforms: Deployed both projects on Firebase for easy hosting and access.
  Automation: Set up automatic deployment through GitHub Actions to streamline updates and changes.

8. Challenges and Solutions
  Cross-Origin Issues: Faced challenges with cross-origin requests but resolved them using postMessage.
  Environment Variables: Set up .env for sensitive information like API keys, ensuring they are not hardcoded in the codebase.
